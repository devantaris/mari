# Risk-Aware Financial Transaction Decision System

## Vision
A production-grade fraud detection and decision intelligence engine combining ensemble machine learning, predictive uncertainty, novelty detection, and cost-aware routing — deployed as a Dockerized FastAPI service with a Vite+React frontend (Glass Lens).

## Requirements

### Validated
- ✓ XGBoost Ensemble Modeling
- ✓ FastAPI backend for predictions
- ✓ Two-axis routing logic (Risk × Uncertainty)
- ✓ Docker containerization
- ✓ Frontend UI (Glass Lens) for decision landscape

### Active
- [ ] Implement future extensions (Live monitoring, thresholds, etc.)

### Out of Scope
- Direct payment processing integrations (focus is purely on decision intelligence/risk scoring)
