# Project State

## Current Position
- Project Initialized (Brownfield mode). Base Risk-Aware Fraud System already implemented.
- GSD workflow configured for YOLO model with standard depth.
- Ready to plan and execute Phase 1 (or any new user requests).

## Recent Progress
- Initialized `.planning/` directory
- Mapped existing project constraints into `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, and `ROADMAP.md`.

## Open Issues
- None. Awaiting next command to begin plan execution (e.g. `/gsd:plan-phase 1`).
